# ASD-Detection-App

## Abstract

Early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is crucial for effective intervention, yet traditional diagnostic methods often suffer from inconsistencies and delays due to subjective assessments. This project proposes a multimodal approach to enhance accuracy by integrating behavioral screening, audio analysis, and image processing. Behavioral assessments utilize the XGBoost algorithm and an LSTM-based sequential neural network (LSTM_ASD_model) for quiz-based evaluation. Audio recordings are analyzed with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, including a custom autism_model, to identify distinct vocal characteristics. Image-based detection applies deep learning through the ResNet50 + LSTM model to recognize facial patterns associated with ASD. The proposed system offers a scalable, objective, and efficient solution, assisting healthcare professionals in timely and reliable ASD detection.

## Overview

The **ASD-Detection-App** is a web-based application built using Streamlit to assist in the detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through various interactive modules. The app includes the following features:

- **Chatbot:** A conversational AI chatbot for user interaction.
- **Quiz Test:** A quiz to assess user responses related to ASD traits using XGBoost and LSTM models.
- **Gaming Tests:** Three interactive games (Emoji Game, Memory Game, Ball Clicker Game) to evaluate user behavior.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python:** Version 3.8–3.11 (TensorFlow is compatible with these versions).
- **ffmpeg:** Required for audio processing (`pydub` and `librosa` dependency).

#### Install ffmpeg on Windows

1. Download `ffmpeg` from [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) (`ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip`).
2. Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\ffmpeg-7.1-essentials_build`).
3. Add the `bin` folder to your system PATH:
   - Right-click Start > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables.
   - Edit `Path` under "System variables" and add `C:\ffmpeg\ffmpeg-7.1-essentials_build\bin`.
   - Click OK and restart your terminal.
4. Verify installation:
   ```
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository (if hosted on GitHub) or copy the project folder to your local machine.

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ASD-Detection-App/app
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`):

```
numpy
streamlit
pandas
librosa
joblib
tensorflow
scikit-learn
google-generativeai
python-dotenv
pymupdf
reportlab
xgboost
pydub
Pillow
```

Install them by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, install the packages manually:

```
pip install numpy streamlit pandas librosa joblib tensorflow scikit-learn google-generativeai python-dotenv pymupdf reportlab xgboost pydub Pillow
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

- Create a `.env` file in the `app` directory.
- Add any required API keys (e.g., for `google-generativeai`):
  ```
  GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
  ```
- The app uses `dotenv` to load these variables.

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Analysis Issues

- **Error: `[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified`**
  - Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and added to your system PATH (see Prerequisites).
- **Error: `Decoding failed. ffmpeg returned error code`**
  - The uploaded `.m4a` file might be corrupted. Test with a different file or convert the file using FFmpeg:
    ```
    ffmpeg -i input.m4a -c:a aac -b:a 192k output.m4a
    ```

### Image Analysis Issues

- **Error: `Failed to process the image`**
  - Ensure the image is valid (open it in an image viewer).
  - Check the file format (should be `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg`).
- **Incorrect Predictions:** If the model consistently predicts "Autistic" or "Non_Autistic":
  - Check the class index mapping in `image_analysis.py` (adjust `if predicted_label == 0` logic).
  - Verify the preprocessing matches the model’s training (e.g., `vgg16.preprocess_input` for VGG16 models).
  - Retrain the model on your dataset if necessary.

### General Issues

- **Package Version Conflicts:** If you encounter dependency errors, pin specific versions in `requirements.txt` (e.g., `tensorflow==2.10.0`).
- **TensorFlow Compatibility:** Ensure your Python (3.8–3.11) and TensorFlow versions are compatible. Use `pip show tensorflow` to check the version.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Add More Models:** Include additional models for audio and image analysis (e.g., Inception for images).
- **Improve Chatbot:** Enhance the chatbot with more advanced conversational capabilities.
- **Expand Quiz:** Add more questions and detailed scoring for the quiz.
- **Visualizations:** Add visualizations for audio MFCC features or image feature maps.
- **User Authentication:** Implement user login to save results or preferences.
